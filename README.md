# Today I learned

We are constantly learning new things. This is a repo to share my (somewhat random) learnings.  
TILs are short Markdown documents (a few sentences + example code) explaining a new concept, bit of syntax, command, or tip that we've learned.

The idea was taken from [thoughtbot/til](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)
